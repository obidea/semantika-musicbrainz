MusicBrainz Mappings
====================

MusicBrainz rdb2rdf mappings for [OBDA Semantika](http://obidea.github.io/semantika-api/) system. Currently we are giving the native mapping language for Semantika, which is TERMAL/XML. In the future the system will be able to support R2RML syntax.

Credits for Barry Norton who has provided the R2RML mappings in his repository site [LinkedBrainz / MusicBrainz-R2RML](https://github.com/LinkedBrainz/MusicBrainz-R2RML). This work is just a pure translation from those mappings.
